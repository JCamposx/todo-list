# Basic todo list using Vue

## Setup

First, clone the repo and move into it.

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/JCamposx/todo-list.vue
cd todo-list
```

After this, frontend and backend servers need to be setup.

### Frontend setup for development

Move to the frontend directory,

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies,

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend setup for production

Move to the frontend directory.

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Build the app.

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the frontend server.

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Backend setup

Backend setup is the same for both development and production. It is necessary
to follow the next steps.

Move to the backend directory.

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the backend server.

```bash
npm run server
```

changes is the port where the app is running.
